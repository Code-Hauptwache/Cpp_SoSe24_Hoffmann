/*
 * manageDataObj.cpp
 * 
 * This version of task 1 from the Exam Preparation Worksheet (Probeklausur SS 24 by Erwin Hoffman) uses a vector of string objects (std::vector<std::string>).
 * Each element in the vector is a string object, managed automatically by the standard library.
 * Memory management is handled automatically, and there is no need to manually delete the strings.
 * This approach reduces the risk of memory leaks and simplifies the code.
