### Task 4: Analysis of Generated Code

**Objective**:
- To analyze the machine code of the compiled program using the `gdb` debugger and compare the assembler instructions with the original code.

**Steps Taken**:
1. **Compiling the Code with Debug Symbols**:
   - Command: `g++ -g -o complx_main complx_main.cpp`
   - Ensured the executable had debugging information.

2. **Starting `gdb`**:
   - Command: `gdb complx_main`
   - Loaded the executable into `gdb`.

3. **Setting Breakpoints and Running the Program**:
   - Set a breakpoint at `main`: `break main`
   - Ran the program: `run`

4. **Stepping Through the Code**:
   - Used `next` to step through the code line-by-line.
   - Example: After running `next`, the value of `a` was observed to be `(1.0, 1.0)`.

5. **Inspecting Variables**:
   - Used `print a` to inspect the variable `a`.

6. **Continuing Execution**:
   - Used `continue` to proceed with the program execution.

**Observations**:
- The program executed as expected, producing the correct outputs for addition, subtraction, multiplication, conjugation, and magnitude calculations.
- The assembly instructions corresponded correctly to the C++ code lines.

**Conclusion**:
- The debugging session confirmed that the program logic was implemented correctly.
- No significant issues were found during the debugging process.
